# Epic React - Advance React Patterns

## Lessons

### Lesson 01 - Context Module Functions

- Hot tip: `Context.displayName = 'MyContext'` to improve discoverability in DevTools
- Avoids the need to wrap exported helper function in `useCallback` and removes state update complexity from within component logic by encapsulating it in helper methods that are passed dispatch and data needed to update context state
